## This is the Django tutorial app 
I followed the documentation here [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/). 
These YouTube tutorials helped as well [Building a web application with Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOPWsnJU62A&list=PLiEts138s9P1neYx6V1FHacRLrr28CZ-C). 
I found out I would be working with this framework, which is why I decided to do the beginner project tutorial.

## I will be making this a Aot polls app.
